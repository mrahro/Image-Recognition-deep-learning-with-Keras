# Image-Recognition-deep-learning-with-Keras

Applying keras and tensorflow to 3 groups of images:
- distingushing food types
- distinguishing sideways flippled images
- distingushing fashion images content

This notebook employs keras and tensorflow with following content:

- builiding models from convolutions
- transfer learning
- data augmentation
- striding and dropouts
